## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of SecureVault seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us responsibly.

### Please Do Not

- Open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
- Disclose the vulnerability publicly before it has been addressed

### Please Do

1. **Email the maintainer** with details of the vulnerability
   - Include steps to reproduce the issue
   - Describe the potential impact
   - Suggest a fix if possible

2. **Allow time for response**
   - We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
   - We will provide an initial assessment within 7 days
   - We will keep you informed of our progress

3. **Coordinate disclosure**
   - We will work with you to understand and address the issue
   - We will credit you in the security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
   - We will coordinate the timing of public disclosure

## Security Best Practices

When using SecureVault, we recommend:

### For Development

- Always use the latest stable version of Rust
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Run `cargo audit` regularly to check for known vulnerabilities
- Enable all clippy lints and address warnings
- Use `cargo-deny` to check for security issues

### For Production

- Use release builds (`cargo build --release`)
- Implement proper access controls
- Use environment variables or secure vaults for sensitive configuration
- Enable logging and monitoring
- Regularly audit transaction history
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints (when applicable)
- Use TLS/SSL for all network communications (when applicable)

### Wallet Security

- **Hot Wallets**: Use for operational funds only
  - Keep minimal balances
  - Monitor transactions frequently
  - Implement transaction limits

- **Cold Wallets**: Use for long-term storage
  - Store in secure, offline environments
  - Implement multi-signature requirements (when feature is available)
  - Regular security audits

### Code Security

- Never commit private keys or sensitive data
- Use secure random number generators
- Validate all inputs
- Handle errors securely (don't leak sensitive information)
- Use constant-time comparisons for sensitive operations

## Security Features

SecureVault includes several security features:

1. **Type Safety**: Rust's type system prevents many common vulnerabilities
2. **Memory Safety**: No buffer overflows or use-after-free bugs
3. **Input Validation**: All operations validate inputs
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages without leaking sensitive data
5. **Audit Trail**: Complete transaction history for compliance

## Planned Security Features

- Multi-signature wallet support
- Hardware Security Module (HSM) integration
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Advanced access controls
- Encryption at rest
- Key rotation capabilities

## Security Audits

We welcome security audits from the community. If you perform a security audit:

1. Document your methodology
2. Report findings responsibly
3. Suggest remediation where possible
4. Allow time for fixes before public disclosure

## Dependencies

We regularly monitor our dependencies for security issues:

```bash
# Check for security vulnerabilities
cargo audit

# Update dependencies
cargo update

# Check for outdated dependencies
cargo outdated
```
